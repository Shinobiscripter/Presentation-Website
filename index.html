    <h2>What Is Inertia?</h2>
    <p>
      Inertia is Newton’s First Law of Motion. It explains that objects resist
      changes in their motion unless an external force acts on them.

  <section class="card slide-up delay">
    <h2>Types of Inertia</h2>
    <p>
      • Inertia of Rest – A book on a table won’t move unless pushed.<br>
      • Inertia of Motion – A rolling ball keeps moving unless slowed.<br>
      • Inertia of Direction – A car turning makes you lean sideways.

  <!-- CARD 3 -->
  <section class="card slide-up delay-2">
    <h2>Force, Motion, and Energy</h2>
    <p>
      Force is a push or pull that can change an object’s motion.
      Motion is the change in position of an object caused by force.

  <!-- CARD 4 -->
  <section class="card slide-up delay-3">
    <h2>Newton’s Laws of Motion</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>1st Law:</strong> Objects stay in motion or rest unless acted on by a force.<br>
      <strong>2nd Law:</strong> Force = mass × acceleration (F = m × a).<br>
      <strong>3rd Law:</strong> For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

    <h2>TEK 8.7B – Force, Motion, and Energy</h2>
    <p>
      This TEK explains how Newton’s Laws of Motion interact with force and
      energy to describe how objects move in the real world.
